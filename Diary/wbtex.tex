In this section we aim to use what we can see from the functions themselves to satisfy some coverage
criteria. To evaluate coverage we will use the coverage.py package. This can evaluate both statement and branch coverage and enumerate which statements or branches were not executed.

As our function contains a loop we want to include loop coverage. 

The function we have chosen to white box test is the multi\_dot() function and it's subsidiary functions \_multi\_dot() and multi\_dot\_three().





\paragraph{Node Coverage}


For node coverage we have the critereon that our tests cause all statements to be executed. Figure 1shows the control flow graph for the functions under test. 



\paragraph{Edge Coverage}

For edge coverage we have the critereon that our tests cause all branches to execute. In this case we have the set of edges \\
\{(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,7),(6,8),(8,9),(8,10),(8,12),(12,10),(10,16),(9,11),(11,13)\\
,(13,14),(13,15),(15,16),(16,17),(16,18),(16,19)\}.
Our test requirements are that every edge is contained in at least one of our test paths.
\\
With the below suite of tests we achieve full node and branch coverage.

\paragraph{Loop Coverage}

A loop is covered if in at least one test the body was executed 0 times, and if in some test the body was executed exactly once, and if in some test the body was executed more than once.




\subsection{Test: Arguments$<$2}
For this case the test test\_multi\_dot\_raises was created. See Appendix for test specifics.
This test gives us node coverage for \{1,2\} and branch coverage for \{(1,2)\}. It returns a raises value error.

\subsection{Test: Arguments=2}

For this case the test test\_multi\_two was created. See Appendix for test specifics.
This test gives us node coverage for \{1,3\} and branch coverage for \{(1,3)\}. It returns the dot product of the two.


\subsection{Test: Arguments=3,dimension of 1st argument = 1}

For this case the test test\_multi\_ndim\_10 was created. See Appendix for test specifics.
This test gives us node coverage for \{1,4,5,6,8,9,11,13,14,16,17\} and branch coverage for \{(1,4),
\\
(4,5),(6,8),(8,9),(9,11),(11,13),(13,14),(14,16),(16,18)\}.




\subsection{Test: Arguments=3,dimension of last argument = 1}

For this case the test test\_multi\_ndim\_01 was created. See Appendix for test specifics.

This test gives us node coverage for \{1,4,6,7,8,9,11,13,15,16,18\} and branch coverage for \{(1,4),

(4,6),(6,7),(7,8),(8,9),(9,11),(11,13),(13,14),(14,16),(16,18)\}.



\subsection{Test: Arguments$<$3,dimension of first and last argument = 1}

For this case the test test\_multi\_ndim\_11 was created. See Appendix for test specifics.

This test gives us node coverage for \{1,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,10,16,17\} and fulfils the requirements that the edges {(8,10),(10,12),(12,10),(16,19)} are executed.


\subsection{Test: Arguments=3,dimension of first and last argument $>$ 1}


For this case the test test\_multi\_ndim\_00 was created. See Appendix for test specifics.
This test gives us node coverage for \{1,4,6,8,9,11,13,14,16,19\} and fulfils the final requirement that the edge (16,19) is executed.
